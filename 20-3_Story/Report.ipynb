    "Reducing the operational climate control energy use of our public buildings is a coherent process combat climate change on a mass level. With climate change on the forefront of our minds, it's easy to stop and analyze how we can modify our own habits at home to minimize energy usage and help address the issue: turning the lights off when not in a room, waiting one extra half hour before turning on the air conditioner at home, turning the shower off while lathering with soap... the list goes on. But how many times have you been at home wearing three layers of sweats, shivering under blankets, and wondering, \"Would it really make that much of a difference if I turned up the heat one degree?\" The answer is that it probably doesn't matter much, at least on the individual home level. If your neighbor treats their house like a sauna, there's likely no limited standard of living you can endure to offset their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, targeting change at our public institutions offers the opportunity to enact a much more significant energy use reduction. For example, did you know that the central branch of the Boston Public Library consumes as much energy in a year as 854 [average American households](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/use-of-energy/electricity-use-in-homes.php)?"

    "The biggest energy use months are July and August, which are typically the hottest months in Boston. Therefore, it's obvious that the air conditioning system is using the most amount of energy to control the climate during business hours. Interestingly, in Boston, the summer population is smaller due to students from the myriad universities returning home for break, as well as the sun being up longer requiring less lighting. From those reasons we'd think the energy use would go down, but in fact it is the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it obvious that one of the biggest issues plaguing excessive energy use is air conditioning during building occupation. Furthermore, large public institutions with multiple buildings dominate the energy use in our communities. Here, we see that the Boston public library allowing a 2 Â°F higher temperature in the summer would be equivalent to 22,000 homes doing the same. It's imperative for our climate future to be mindful of all of our actions, but most importantly our public institutions should be pushed to do better."
